 This tool uses shock characteristics for Half Sine Shock Pulses defined
 in USA Department of Defense Test Method Standard (MIL-STD-810G), Test
 Method #516 to come up with preliminary "static deflection" and
 "stiffness" values for shock isolators to use in processes of possible
 shock isolator choice.

 Metric system is used while developing this tool and required unit type
 for inputs.

 Required inputs:
 - Number of isolators used (Isolator locations are assumed to be
 symmetric)
 - Total Mass of the System
 - Fragility of the Critical Equipment
 
 Referred Inputs:
 - Shock Pulse Magnitude (MIL-STD-810G)
 - Shock Pulse Duration (MIL-STD-810G)
 - Ground Acceleration
